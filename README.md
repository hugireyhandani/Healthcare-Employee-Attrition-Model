# Healthcare Employee Attrition Model

## Overview
This project, part of the MET CS 677 Data Science with Python course at Boston University, is by Hugi Reyhandani Munggaran. It aims to predict employee attrition in the U.S. healthcare sector using the IBM Watson dataset from Kaggle.

## Goals
- Predict healthcare worker attrition.
- Identify key factors contributing to turnover.
- Aid in developing retention strategies.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant features.
- Converted categorical variables for analysis.
- Standardized data for unbiased analysis.

### Data Modeling
- Developed and trained models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy and other metrics.

### Model Comparison
- Identified Logistic Regression as the most effective model with high accuracy and F1 score.
- Focused on balancing precision and recall in imbalanced datasets.

## Conclusion
The project successfully predicts attrition in healthcare workers, with Logistic Regression as a key model.
