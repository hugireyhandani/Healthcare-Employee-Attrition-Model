# Healthcare-Employee-Attrition-Model
Overview
This project, conducted for the MET CS 677 Data Science with Python course at Boston University by Hugi Reyhandani Munggaran, focuses on predicting employee attrition within the healthcare industry in the United States. It leverages data science techniques to address the high turnover rates in this sector, using the IBM Watson dataset available on Kaggle.

Goals
Predict employee attrition among healthcare workers.
Uncover patterns and factors contributing to attrition.
Assist healthcare organizations in implementing effective retention strategies.
Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Removal of duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant features.
Conversion of categorical variables for analysis.
Standardization of data to remove biases.
Data Modeling
Various predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.) were developed and trained.
Models were compared based on accuracy and other metrics to determine the most effective.
Model Comparison
Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective model with high accuracy and F1 score.
Emphasis on a model's ability to balance precision and recall in imbalanced datasets.
Conclusion
The project successfully used machine learning to predict attrition among healthcare workers, highlighting Logistic Regression as a notably effective model.
